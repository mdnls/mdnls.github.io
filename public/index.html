                I’m interested in the intrinsic structures hidden inside data and the conditions under which these structures can be recovered, compressed, or visualized. I am lucky to have been advised by <a href="https://khoury.northeastern.edu/home/hand/">Dr. Paul Hand</a> and <a href="https://mkilme01.pages.tufts.edu/">Dr. Misha Kilmer</a> on topics in imaging inverse problems, generative modeling with deep neural networks, and compression methods for multiway data.

                    <p>In an imaging inverse problem, one must recover missing information about a target image using prior assumptions on the image structure. We show that Invertible Neural Networks can be used to vastly outperform classical approaches when one has access to a dataset of known images.</p>
